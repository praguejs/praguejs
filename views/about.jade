    h3 [September 2016]: Prague JS & ReactiveConf do Reactive Prague Meetups!

    The Czech JavaScript user group and the second biggest tech conference on React come together to bring the best speakers from all around the world to the beautiful city of Prague.
    From now on, the regular Reactive Prague Meetups are going to be a unique opportunity to meet, reach and get inspired. Join the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/reactivepraguemeetups/">Reactive Prague Meetups</a> group on facebook for future info.

    And we're kicking-off on Monday, September 26th, with none other than Adam Miskiewicz, a core contributor to ExponentJS and React Native.

    h3 Meetups
    p
    | If you want to talk to people before the talks start, get there at 17:45.
    | The first talk then starts at 18:00. We aim for talks with Q&A afterwards. We also have open discussion that can take a while longer.
    | We are very open to any ideas and forms of meetups. You can talk for as long you want about almost everything. Just come and talk to us.

    h3 Speakers
    p
    | We're looking for two talks every month, and while some speakers come back, new speakers are always needed and welcome.
    | In general a small meetup like this is a great way to get started with doing conference talks.
